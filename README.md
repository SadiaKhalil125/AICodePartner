## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Dynamic Problem Generation**: Leverages AI to create unique coding problems based on user-selected criteria, including **language**, **difficulty** (Easy, Medium, Hard), and **topic** (e.g., Arrays, Graphs, DP).
- **Professional Code Editor**: Integrates the **Monaco Editor** (the engine behind VS Code) for a rich, familiar coding experience with syntax highlighting and intelligent suggestions.
- **AI-Powered Feedback & Scoring**: Users can submit their code to an AI service that provides a score (out of 10) and constructive suggestions for improvement, helping them understand their mistakes and learn best practices.
- **Secure User Authentication**: A complete authentication system with JWT for user registration and login, ensuring all user data and submissions are secure.
- **Personalized User Dashboard**: A comprehensive dashboard that visualizes a user's progress, including statistics on problems solved, accuracy rates, and a breakdown by difficulty.
- **Submission History**: Users can view a complete history of their past submissions, including the problem, language, and pass/fail status.
- **Modern, Responsive UI**: A sleek and intuitive user interface built with React, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project is a full-stack application built with a modern and robust technology stack:

- **Frontend**:
  - **React.js**: A declarative, component-based library for building user interfaces.
  - **React Router**: For client-side routing and navigation between pages.
  - **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
  - **Monaco Editor React**: To integrate the professional VS Code editor.
  - **Lucide React**: For a lightweight and beautiful icon set.

- **Backend**:
  - **FastAPI (Python)**: A high-performance, modern web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
  - **Pydantic**: For data validation and settings management.
  - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For secure user authentication.

- **Database**:
  - **MongoDB**: A NoSQL, document-oriented database used for storing user data, problems, and submissions.

- **AI Integration**:
  - The backend is using Langchain to communicate with hugging face open source meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct model to generate problems and code suggestions.
